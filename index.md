**SecBase** is the Open Source API that helps companies to **mitigate data breaches** and to **accelerate compliance** to security standards such as PCI/DSS, HIPAA and GDPR.

Implement its _developer-friendly_ APIs and then:
*   **Run** workflows & analytics on fully **encrypted data**
*   Use the right **encryption** or **tokenization** technique for your data
*   Exploit **hardware security** for sensitive data in the **Cloud**
*   Data **Residency**, Access **Control**, **Policy** Enforcement, **Audit** Logs


### Philosophy
*   **Security** should be **Open Source**: reviewed by the community
*   **Everyone** should be able to run it **anywhere**: on-premise, cloud, avoiding vendor lock-in
*   **Extensible** with custom integrations and plugins
